this year, i'm following along with thebracket's roguelike tutorial in Rust, using rltk/bracket-lib. for most of these 8 weeks i'll probably just be whittling away at the content and trying not to diverge too much, since it's a really lengthy one and finishing it in time might be a task, but the ultimate aim post-sprint is to strip out the data and existing entities and replace them with my own, using the systems and components as a jumping-off point for a rl of my own
