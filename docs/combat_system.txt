DETERMINING IF AN ATTACK HITS OR NOT:

1. Whenever someone makes an attack, a flat 1d20 attack roll is made.
2. A target number is generated, depending on the mode of attack, made
   up of some combination of the following:
        - ATTACKER'S HIT BONUSES:
            - level
            - any relevant str/dex attribute bonuses
            - any relevant skill modifiers
            - any to-hit modifiers from equipment
            - any to-hit modifiers from status effects
        - DEFENDER'S ARMOUR CLASS*:
            - base armour class
            - any relevant skill modifiers
            - any ac modifiers from equipment
            - any ac modifiers from status effects
        - MISCELLANEOUS MODIFIERS:
            - melee attacks always have a +1 bonus
            - monsters gain a +10 bonus to-hit players
3. The attack roll is compared against the target number.
4. If the attack roll is less than the target, the attack hits.**
5. If an attack hits, it deals:
        - a roll of the weapon's damage die
        - plus any relevant attribute bonuses
        - plus any relevant skill modifiers
        - MINUS a roll of the defender's AC, if the AC is negative.

notes
    * when AC is less than 0, it is treated as a random number from -1 to the value. e.g. -10 AC could be anywhere from -1 to -10.
    ** functionally identical to rolling 1d20 + to-hit, and needing to roll higher than the defender's AC. this system just ends up
       being easier to work with when involving additional modifiers, as you don't need to decide if they're a to-hit bonus or an
       AC modifier -- they just always get added/subtracted from the target number that must be rolled against.

Simple example, with positive AC:
- You have an AC of 4, and the monster has a +1 to-hit, with a 1d8 damage weapon. 
- The monster must roll less than 10 (monster v. player) + 1 (to-hit) + 4 (ac) = 15 to hit you. 
- The monster has a 70% hit chance.
- It rolls a 12, which is lower than 15, so it hits.
- It rolls 1d8 for damage, and gets a 6.
- You take 6 points of damage.

Complex example, with negative AC:
- You have an AC of -14, and the monster has a +3 to-hit, with a 1d8 damage weapon.
- The monster must roll less than 10 (monster v. player) + 3 (to-hit) - 1d14 (ac) to hit you.
- At best (AC rolls a 1), the monster must roll less than 12 to hit you. 55% hit chance.
- At worst (AC rolls a 14), the monster must roll less than -1 to hit you. Impossible.
- It rolls a 9, and your AC rolls a 2. 9 is less than 11 (10 + 3 - 2), so it hits.
- It rolls 1d8 for damage, and gets a 6.
- You have negative AC, so you roll 1d14 for damage reduction, and get an 8.
- The total damage is 6 - 8 = -2, but damage can't be negative, so you take 1 point of damage.
