- overmap: bare, but exists. player now starts on the overworld, and can move to local maps (like the old starting town) via >. can leave local maps back to the overmap by walking out of the map boundaries.
- mouse begone: support still there if wanted, but targeting/e(x)amining can now be done via keyboard only
- config.toml: non-wasm builds read from config.toml at runtime, or generate a new copy if not present in the exe dir. includes options for logging various details to the console, and visual choices like post-processing effects, all-black bgs vs. full-coloured, etc.
- morgue files: y/n prompt to write a morgue file on death (or write to console in the case of wasm), containing a map of the floor the player died on, class/race/attribute/etc. details, a fully identified backpack, and a list of significant events that took place this run w/ turn number 
- refactored colour offsets: now per-tile (and per-theme), instead of global. now can include varying fg/bg offset for every type of tile.
- consistent chatlog colours: renderables for mobs, beatitude for items
- rooms themes: grassy room theme proof-of-concept, propagates grass/foliage/etc. out from a room if rolled, and spawns themed mobs
- map identifiers (instead of displaying an incorrect depth) on ui: e.g. D1, D2, Town, Woods, etc.
- bugfixes:
    - map params are saved on map transition, instead of only at creation. now bloodstains, vision, etc. will persist when changing between floors
    - mob turns await an empty particle queue - no longer will they move mid-fireball animations
    - fixed traffic jams - 1. mobs will calc the best path to any tile within range of their target, instead of trying to path directly onto the target tile, and 2. if saved path is blocked to a waypoint, mobs will recalc a new path to the same point
